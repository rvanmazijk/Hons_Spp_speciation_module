abstract = {Charles Darwin introduced a novel idea into the concept of species, namely that species are branches in the lines of descent (segments of population lineages). In addition to this novel evolutionary component, Darwin's species concept also retained an older taxonomic component, namely the view that the species category is a taxonomic rank; moreover, he adopted amount of difference as a criterion for ranking lineages as species. Subsequent biologists retained both components of Darwin's species concept, although they replaced Darwin's ranking criterion with ranking criteria that either are more objectively defined or relate more directly to the biological bases of lineage separation and divergence. Numerous alternative ranking criteria were proposed, resulting in a prolifera-tion of species definitions and a controversy concerning the concept of species. That controversy can be resolved by distinguishing more explicitly between the theoretical concept of species and the operational criteria that are used to apply the concept in practice. By viewing the various alternative ranking criteria as operational indicators of lineage separation rather than necessary properties of species, the conflicts among competing species concepts are eliminated, resulting in a unified concept of species. A brief examination of the history of biology reveals that an important shift related to the unified species concept has been emerging ever since Darwin reformulated the concept of species with an evolutionary basis. The species category is effectively being decoupled from the hierarchy of taxonomic ranks and transferred to the hierarchy of biological organization. Published 2011.

abstract = {We define a genetic species as a group of genetically compatible interbreeding natural populations that is genetically isolated from other such groups. This focus on genetic isolation rather than reproductive isolation distinguishes the Genetic Species Concept from the Biological Species Concept. Recognition of species that are genetically isolated (but not reproductively isolated) results in an enhanced understanding of biodiversity and the nature of speciation as well as speciation-based issues and evolution of mammals. We review criteria and methods for recognizing species of mammals and explore a theoretical scenario, the Bateson–Dobzhansky–Muller (BDM) model, for understanding and predicting genetic diversity and speciation in mammals. If the BDM model is operating in mammals, then genetically defined phylogroups would be predicted to occur within species defined by morphology, and phylogroups experiencing stabilizing selection will evolve genetic isolation without concomitant morphological diversification. Such species will be undetectable using classical skin and skull morphology (Morphological Species Concept). Using cytochrome-b data from sister species of mammals recognized by classical morphological studies, we estimated the number of phylogroups that exist within mammalian species and hypothesize that there will be {\textgreater}2,000 currently unrecognized species of mammals. Such an underestimation significantly affects conclusions on the nature of speciation in mammals, barriers associated with evolution of genetic isolation, estimates of biodiversity, design of conservation initiatives, zoonoses, and so on. A paradigm shift relative to this and other speciation-based issues will be needed. Data that will be effective in detecting these " morphologically cryptic genetic species " are genetic, especially DNA-sequence data. Application of the Genetic Species Concept uses genetic data from mitochondrial and nuclear genomes to identify species and species boundaries, the extent to which the integrity of the gene pool is protected, nature of hybridization (if present), and introgression. Genetic data are unique in understanding species because the use of genetic data 1) can quantify genetic divergence from different aspects of the genome (mitochondrial and nuclear genes, protein coding genes, regulatory genes, mobile DNA, microsatellites, chromosomal rearrangements, heterochromatin, etc.); 2) can provide divergence values that increase with time, providing an estimate of time since divergence; 3) can provide a population genetics perspective; 4) is less subject to convergence and parallelism relative to other sets of characters; 5) can identify monophyly, sister taxa, and presence or absence of introgression; and 6) can accurately identify hybrid individuals (kinship and source of hybrid individuals, F 1 s, backcrosses, direction of hybridization, and in concert with other data identify which hybrids are sterile or fertile). The proposed definition of the Genetic Species Concept is more compatible with a description of biodiversity of mammals than is " reproductively isolated species. " Genetic profiles of mammalian species will result in a genetic description of species and mammalian diversity, and such studies are being accelerated by technological advances that reduce cost and increase speed and efficiency of generating genetic data.},

abstract = {The way we view the Species category in Primates, as in other animals, especially other vertebrates, has been going through a revolution over the past 20 years or so. Much is wrong with the idea that we can define species according to whether or not they are "reproductively isolated": this concept, the so-called Biological Species Concept, has never offered any guidelines in the case of allopatric populations; this has now been shown to be simply wrong. Although other ways of looking at species - the Evolutionary, Recognition, Cohesion and Genetic Species Concepts - have all provided particular insights, the only proposal to offer a repeatable, falsifiable definition of species is the Phylogenetic Species Concept. This has been criticised for increasing the number of species to be recognised, although it is not clear why this should be a problem: indeed, it tells us that the world is far richer in biodiversity than we had conceived.},

abstract = {The taxonomy of gray four-eyed opossums, genus Philander, from northern South America is reviewed by means of comparative morphological and morphometric analyses. Two hundred eighteen specimens belonging to the following geographic samples were used: P. opossum opossum from French Guiana, Guyana, and Suriname; P. o. fuscogriseus from Central America and Colombia; P. andersoni from Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Vene-zuela; P. opossum from the Orinoco River delta (Venezuela); P. opossum from western Venezuela and eastern Colombia; and P. opossum from central Venezuela. Results obtained allow us to describe 2 new Philander species, one of which occurs in the floodplains of the Orinoco River delta and Paria Gulf (Venezuela), and the other of which is distributed in lowlands and uplands at the northern border of the Guiana Shield in Venezuela, as far as the Orinoco River, and foothills of Cordillera Oriental (Colombia) and Cordillera of M{\'{e}}rida (Venezuela). These new taxa were formerly considered to represent forms of P. opossum. In particular, it was suggested that specimens from the Orinoco delta constituted a subspecies of P. opossum, but this taxonomic pattern was not supported with detailed comparative analyses. Furthermore, the subspecific status of animals from western Venezuela and eastern Colombia was controversial and specimens from central Venezuela were considered as P. opossum but no empirical data supported this taxonomic identity. With respect to the other Philander species here considered, the 1st new species clearly differs in features concerning general skull shape and morphology, by its smaller skull size, relatively shorter tail, presence of a wide gray area in the underparts of the coat, and smaller and poorly defined supraorbital spots. The 2nd new species can be distinguished from the other Philander taxa by the general skull shape (relatively wide and short), specific skull traits, pale gray dorsum, and the characteristic coloration of ears (white with a wide black margin).},

abstract = {The genus Thylamys Gray, 1843 lives in the central and southern portions of South America inhabiting open and shrub-like vegetation, from prairies to dry forest habitats in contrast to the preference of other Didelphidae genera for more mesic environments. Thylamys is a speciose genus including T. elegans (Waterhouse, 1839), T. macrurus (Olfers, 1818), T. pallidior (Thomas, 1902), T. pusillus (Desmarest, 1804), T. venustus (Thomas, 1902), T. sponsorius (Thomas, 1921), T. cinderella (Thomas, 1902), T. tatei (Handley, 1957), T. karimii (Petter, 1968), and T. velutinus (Wagner, 1842) species. Previous phylogenetic analyses in this genus did not include the Brazilian species T. karimii, which is widely distributed in this country. In this study, phylogenetic analyses were performed to establish the relationships among the Brazilian T. karimii and all other previously analyzed species. We used 402-bp fragments of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, and the phylogeny estimates were conducted employing maximum parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML), Bayesian (BY), and neighbor-joining (NJ). The topologies of the trees obtained in the different analyses were all similar and pointed out that T. karimii is the sister taxon of a group constituted of taxa from dry and arid environments named the dryland species. The dryland species consists of T. pusillus, T. pallidior, T. tatei, and T. elegans. The results of this work suggest five species groups in Thylamys. In one of them, T. velutinus and T. kariimi could constitute a sister group forming one Thylamys clade that colonized Brazil.},

INTRODUCTION Two species of Myosorex, viz M. varitls (Smuts, 1832) and M. cafer (Sundevall, 1846), are known from Southern Africa (Meester, 1958). M. cafer occurs on the eastern escarpment of Rhodesia, the Soutpansberg, the eastern escarpment of the Transvaal, Zululand, and along the coastal districts of Natal and the Eastern Cape as far south as King William's Town. M. varills is broadly sympatric with M. cafer except along the Soutpansberg and on the eastern escarpment of Rhodesia [where, how-ever, .M. c4er intergrades morphologically with j{\~{}}l. varills (see Meester, 1958)], and also occurs in the Transvaal highveld, the northeastern Orange Free State, Lesotho and the coastal districts of the Cape Province, as far as Port Nolloth in the northwest.},

Several patterns associated with DNA-sequence variation emerged from this study. Specif-ically, genetic distance values Ͻ2{\%} were indicative of intraspecific variation; values be-tween 2 and 11{\%} had a high probability of being indicative of conspecific populations or valid species and merit additional study concerning specific status; and values Ͼ11{\%} were indicative of specific recognition. It appears that genetic distance values may be useful for determination of species boundaries under the framework of the Genetic Species Concept.},
