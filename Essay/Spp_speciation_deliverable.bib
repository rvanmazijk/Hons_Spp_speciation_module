abstract = {The three missions of Systematics Agenda 2000 (SA2000)—to inventory Earth's species, to understand their rela-tionships, and to use the latter to create predictive information systems—define an agenda of research for systematic biology. The recognition that systematic knowledge underpins biological knowledge in general, and applied biology in particular, has resulted in an amazing growth in systematics over the past decade. Increasingly, systematics is being used to solve societal problems. This paper describes seven great questions within systematics and discusses their relevance for, and contribution to, conserving and sustainably using biodiversity. These questions fall into four broad categories: Questions about diversity: What is a species? and How many species are there? Questions about phylogeny: What is the Tree of Life? and What has been the history of character transformation? Questions about biogeography: Where are Earth's species distributed? and How have species' distributions changed over time? and Questions about phyloinformatics: How is phylogenetic history predictive?},

abstract = {The genus Thylamys Gray, 1843 lives in the central and southern portions of South America inhabiting open and shrub-like vegetation, from prairies to dry forest habitats in contrast to the preference of other Didelphidae genera for more mesic environments. Thylamys is a speciose genus including T. elegans (Waterhouse, 1839), T. macrurus (Olfers, 1818), T. pallidior (Thomas, 1902), T. pusillus (Desmarest, 1804), T. venustus (Thomas, 1902), T. sponsorius (Thomas, 1921), T. cinderella (Thomas, 1902), T. tatei (Handley, 1957), T. karimii (Petter, 1968), and T. velutinus (Wagner, 1842) species. Previous phylogenetic analyses in this genus did not include the Brazilian species T. karimii, which is widely distributed in this country. In this study, phylogenetic analyses were performed to establish the relationships among the Brazilian T. karimii and all other previously analyzed species. We used 402-bp fragments of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, and the phylogeny estimates were conducted employing maximum parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML), Bayesian (BY), and neighbor-joining (NJ). The topologies of the trees obtained in the different analyses were all similar and pointed out that T. karimii is the sister taxon of a group constituted of taxa from dry and arid environments named the dryland species. The dryland species consists of T. pusillus, T. pallidior, T. tatei, and T. elegans. The results of this work suggest five species groups in Thylamys. In one of them, T. velutinus and T. kariimi could constitute a sister group forming one Thylamys clade that colonized Brazil.},

abstract = {DNA barcoding has become a well-funded, global enterprise since its proposition as a technique for species identification, delimitation and discovery in 2003. However, the rapid development of next generation sequencing (NGS) has the potential to render DNA barcoding irrelevant because of the speed with which it generates large volumes of genomic data. To avoid obsolescence, the DNA barcoding movement must adapt to use this new technology. This review examines the DNA barcoding enterprise, its continued resistance to improvement and the implications of this on the future of the discipline. We present the consistent failure of DNA barcoding to recognize its limitations and evolve its methodologies, reducing the usefulness of the data produced by the movement and throwing into doubt its ability to embrace NGS.},

abstract = {Levels of sequence variation in mitochondrial cytochrome- b gene were examined to ascertain if this molecule can provide a reference point in making decisions concerning species-level distinctions. DNA-sequence data from 4 genera of rodents ( Neotoma , Reithrodontomys , Peromyscus , and Sigmodon ) and 7 genera of bats ( Artibeus , Carollia , Chiroderma , Dermanura , Glossophaga , Rhinophylla , and Uroderma ), including recognized sister species, were examined to develop hypotheses for evaluating levels of sequence variation. Several patterns associated with DNA-sequence variation emerged from this study. Specifically, genetic distance values {\textless}2{\%} were indicative of intraspecific variation; values between 2 and 11{\%} had a high probability of being indicative of conspecific populations or valid species and merit additional study concerning specific status; and values {\textgreater}11{\%} were indicative of specific recognition. It appears that genetic distance values may be useful for determination of species boundaries under the framework of the Genetic Species Concept.},

abstract = {We present a draft genome sequence of the platypus, Ornithorhynchus anatinus. This monotreme exhibits a fascinating combination of reptilian and mammalian characters. For example, platypuses have a coat of fur adapted to an aquatic lifestyle; platypus females lactate, yet lay eggs; and males are equipped with venom similar to that of reptiles. Analysis of the first monotreme genome aligned these features with genetic innovations. We find that reptile and platypus venom proteins have been co-opted independently from the same gene families; milk protein genes are conserved despite platypuses laying eggs; and immune gene family expansions are directly related to platypus biology. Expansions of protein, non-protein-coding RNA and microRNA families, as well as repeat elements, are identified. Sequencing of this genome now provides a valuable resource for deep mammalian comparative analyses, as well as for monotreme biology and conservation.},

Although the new biotechnological techniques allow more accurate data, the diagnosis based on morphometric analyses permits the primary identification of the taxonomic group origin to support the best choice of subsequent analyses. We present the compilation list of fecal shape and measurements available in the literature published in North America, Eastern and Southern Africa, Europe, and new data from Brazil. Shape and diameters are the best characteristics for taxonomic identification. Feces were assembled in 9 groups that reflect the Order, sometimes the Family, and even their common origin.},

abstract = {The taxonomy of gray four-eyed opossums, genus Philander, from northern South America is reviewed by means of comparative morphological and morphometric analyses. Two hundred eighteen specimens belonging to the following geographic samples were used: P. opossum opossum from French Guiana, Guyana, and Suriname; P. o. fuscogriseus from Central America and Colombia; P. andersoni from Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela; P. opossum from the Orinoco River delta (Venezuela); P. opossum from western Venezuela and eastern Colombia; and P. opossum from central Venezuela. Results obtained allow us to describe 2 new Philander species, one of which occurs in the floodplains of the Orinoco River delta and Paria Gulf (Venezuela), and the other of which is distributed in lowlands and uplands at the northern border of the Guiana Shield in Venezuela, as far as the Orinoco River, and foothills of Cordillera Oriental (Colombia) and Cordillera of Me´rida (Venezuela). These new taxa were formerly considered to represent forms of P. opossum. In particular, it was suggested that specimens from the Orinoco delta constituted a subspecies of P. opossum, but this taxonomic pattern was not supported with detailed comparative analyses. Furthermore, the subspecific status of animals from western Venezuela and eastern Colombia was controversial and specimens from central Venezuela were considered as P. opossum but no empirical data supported this taxonomic identity. With respect to the other Philander species here considered, the 1st new species clearly differs in features concerning general skull shape and morphology, by its smaller skull size, relatively shorter tail, presence of a wide gray area in the underparts of the coat, and smaller and poorly defined supraorbital spots. The 2nd new species can be distinguished from the other Philander taxa by the general skull shape (relatively wide and short), specific skull traits, pale gray dorsum, and the characteristic coloration of ears (white with a wide black margin).},

abstract = {Humans primarily rely on vision when categorizing the world. If you just look at the same-sized but strikingly differently colored Neotropical poison-dart frogs such as strawberry frogs (Fig. ), you would be convinced that they must belong to different species. However, this is an excellent example of a polymorphic species, meaning that although these frogs look quite different, mating decisions are made based on their conspicuous and species-specific advertisements calls, which are not primarily linked to specific color pattern. The situation is quite different among nocturnal primates living in dense forest environments, such as the tiny nocturnal Malagasy mouse lemurs. In this case, even geographically isolated, well-accepted species look superficially quite similar and are therefore often termed cryptic species (Fig. ). Some morphs are a bit larger than others or show minor phenotypic differences, but morph-specific differences are difficult to detect in living subjects. This phenomenon explains why, until the end of the last century, species diversity in mouse lemurs was assumed to be low, with only two morphologically distinct species. Over the last two decades, several international working groups, including our own, undertook a massive island-wide sampling effort, including DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of mouse lemurs. These revealed a 10-fold higher species diversity, with 21 currently described species. Are these new species, mostly defined based on the phylogenetic species concept (sensu Cracraft), or independent evolutionary lineages or, perhaps, only artifacts of taxonomic inflation? What is a species? How can we identify primate species? How and why do species emerge during evolution?},

Comparing results with WordNet, we find that the algorithm misses some concepts and links, but also that it discovers many additional ones lacking in WordNet.

abstract = {Until a few decades ago, phylogenetic relationships among placental orders were ambiguous and usually depicted to radiate as an unresolved "bush." Resolution of this bush by various workers has been progressing slowly, but with promising results corroborated by nondental, dental, and molecular characters. In this study we continue to seek resolution. A total of 258 nondental and 2 dental characters was analyzed by PAUP and MacClade on 39 vertebrate taxa (3 reptiles, 1 nonmammalian therapsid, and 35 mammals; 20 of the mammals are extant and 15 are extinct) to study higher taxonomic relationships with emphasis on Placentalia (Eutheria). About two-thirds of the characters are osteological, the rest concern soft tissues, including myological but excluding molecular characters (most are our data, the rest are from the literature). Cladistic analysis included all 39 taxa (fossil taxa help to evaluate polarities of characters) and all characters were given equal weight. Extant Mammalia are divided into Prototheria and Theria, the latter into Marsupialia and Placentalia. Placentalia comprises Xenarthra and Epitheria. Within Epitheria, Lipotyphla and Preptotheria (emended) are sister-taxa. Preptotherian taxa group into: ungulate-related taxa and various nonungulates. The former include Carnivora, Pholidota, Tubulidentata, Artiodactyla, Cetacea, Perissodactyla, Hyracoidea, Proboscidea, and Sirenia. A possible association to embrace Lagomorpha, Rodentia, Macroscelidea, Scandentia, Primates, Chiroptera, and Dermoptera is suggested. Significant differences between our findings and those of recent investigators include the dissociation of Pholidota from Xenarthra and the plesiomorphous position of Lipotyphla within Epitheria. Congruence between morphological and molecular results is closer than previously reported.},

abstract = {We define a genetic species as a group of genetically compatible interbreeding natural populations that is genetically isolated from other such groups. This focus on genetic isolation rather than reproductive isolation distinguishes the Genetic Species Concept from the Biological Species Concept. Recognition of species that are genetically isolated (but not reproductively isolated) results in an enhanced understanding of biodiversity and the nature of speciation as well as speciation-based issues and evolution of mammals. We review criteria and methods for recognizing species of mammals and explore a theoretical scenario, the Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller (BDM) model, for understanding and predicting genetic diversity and speciation in mammals. If the BDM model is operating in mammals, then genetically defined phylogroups would be predicted to occur within species defined by morphology, and phylogroups experiencing stabilizing selection will evolve genetic isolation without concomitant morphological diversification. Such species will be undetectable using classical skin and skull morphology (Morphological Species Concept). Using cytochrome-b data from sister species of mammals recognized by classical morphological studies, we estimated the number of phylogroups that exist within mammalian species and hypothesize that there will be {\textgreater}2,000 currently unrecognized species of mammals. Such an underestimation significantly affects conclusions on the nature of speciation in mammals, barriers associated with evolution of genetic isolation, estimates of biodiversity, design of conservation initiatives, zoonoses, and so on. A paradigm shift relative to this and other speciation-based issues will be needed. Data that will be effective in detecting these "morphologically cryptic genetic species" are genetic, especially DNA-sequence data. Application of the Genetic Species Concept uses genetic data from mitochondrial and nuclear genomes to identify species and species boundaries, the extent to which the integrity of the gene pool is protected, nature of hybridization (if present), and introgression. Genetic data are unique in understanding species because the use of genetic data 1) can quantify genetic divergence from different aspects of the genome (mitochondrial and nuclear genes, protein coding genes, regulatory genes, mobile DNA, microsatellites, chromosomal rearrangements, heterochromatin, etc.); 2) can provide divergence values that increase with time, providing an estimate of time since divergence; 3) can provide a population genetics perspective; 4) is less subject to convergence and parallelism relative to other sets of characters; 5) can identify monophyly, sister taxa, and presence or absence of introgression; and 6) can accurately identify hybrid individuals (kinship and source of hybrid individuals, F(1)s, backcrosses, direction of hybridization, and in concert with other data identify which hybrids are sterile or fertile). The proposed definition of the Genetic Species Concept is more compatible with a description of biodiversity of mammals than is "reproductively isolated species." Genetic profiles of mammalian species will result in a genetic description of species and mammalian diversity, and such studies are being accelerated by technological advances that reduce cost and increase speed and efficiency of generating genetic data. We propose that this genetic revolution remain museum- and voucher specimen-based and that new names are based on a holotype (including associated tissues) deposited in an accredited museum.},

abstract = {Mammals are a natural group composed of three principal clades of extant species: monotremes (oviparous), metatherians (viviparous marsupials), and eutherians (viviparous placentals). From a systematics point of view, extant mammals are subdivided into 28 orders and 134 families, unequally distributed among monotremes (1 order/2 fami- lies), marsupials (7 orders/19 families), and placentals (20 orders/113 families). Placentals are in turn divided into 3 principal clades (afrotherians, xenarthrans, and boreoeutherians), with the relationships among the 3 difficult to resolve. A strong geographical component allows for a precise biogeographical reconstruction of the most ancient groups of mammals originated in the Late Triassic and distributed mainly in Australia (monotremes, marsupials), Africa (afrotherians), South America (marsupials, xenarthrans), North America (marsupials, boreoeutherians), and Eurasia (boreoeutherians). The phylogeny of mammals also makes it possible to point out five unique characters (dentary bone, no intermediate bones in the mandibular joint, three bones in the inner ear, development of hair, and production of milk) and a tendency toward giving birth to increasingly underdeveloped young, increasing separation between the digestive and urogenital orifices, and ribs limited to the thoracic region. Although morphological and physiological characters have historically provided the basis for a natural classification reflecting the evolution of mammals, there are other convergent characters in certain groups that have not facilitated systematics; notably among them, a derived epitheliochorial placenta, hooves (former “ungulates”), or the development of dentition related to the type of food (former “insectivores”). In this chapter the supraspe- cific systematics of the 5200 extant species is analyzed in the light of morphological and molecular data, and the most important groups of extinct tetrapods in the evolutionary line of mammals are discussed. The still-enigmatic origin of elephants and whales and the evo- lution of Homo sapiens are also addressed in detail in this chapter.},

abstract = {Charles Darwin introduced a novel idea into the concept of species, namely that species are branches in the lines of descent (segments of population lineages). In addition to this novel evolutionary component, Darwin's species concept also retained an older taxonomic component, namely the view that the species category is a taxonomic rank; moreover, he adopted amount of difference as a criterion for ranking lineages as species. Subsequent biologists retained both components of Darwin's species concept, although they replaced Darwin's ranking criterion with ranking criteria that either are more objectively defined or relate more directly to the biological bases of lineage separation and divergence. Numerous alternative ranking criteria were proposed, resulting in a prolifera- tion of species definitions and a controversy concerning the concept of species. That controversy can be resolved by distinguishing more explicitly between the theoretical concept of species and the operational criteria that are used to apply the concept in practice. By viewing the various alternative ranking criteria as operational indicators of lineage separation rather than necessary properties of species, the conflicts among competing species concepts are eliminated, resulting in a unified concept of species. A brief examination of the history of biology reveals that an important shift related to the unified species concept has been emerging ever since Darwin reformulated the concept of species with an evolutionary basis. The species category is effectively being decoupled from the hierarchy of taxonomic ranks and transferred to the hierarchy of biological organization. Published 2011.

abstract = {We tested the efficiency of cytochrome oxidase I (COI)-barcoding as a taxonomic tool to discriminate and identify sympatric shrew species on Mount Nimba (Guinea). We identified 148 specimens at the species level using morphological characters and comparison with type specimens, including several taxa from Mount Nimba. We identified ten morphospecies and tested aspects of genetic diversity and monophyly using genetic data from three mitochondrial (16S, cytochrome b, and COI) and one nuclear marker (the breast cancer gene, BRCA). Nine morphospecies were validated under the phylogenetic and genetic species concepts, including the recently diverged species Crocidura buettikoferi, Crocidura theresae, and Crocidura grandiceps. Under the same concepts, our analyses revealed the presence of two cryptic species amongst animals identified as Crocidura muricauda. We then tested the efficiency of barcoding thanks to commonly used phenetic methods, with the 148 specimens representing 11 potentially valid species based on morphological and molecular data. We show that COI-barcoding is a powerful tool for shrew identification and can be used for taxonomic surveys. The comparison of genetic divergence values shows the presence of a barcoding gap (i.e. difference between the highest intraspecific and the lowest interspecific genetic divergence values). Given that only a few COI sequences are available for Afrotropical shrews, our work is an important step forward toward their enrichment. We also tested the efficiency of the three other sequenced markers and found that cytochrome b is as efficient as COI for barcoding shrews.{\textcopyright} 2012 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2012, 166, 672–687.},

abstract = {Thirty-five museum specimens collected in 1926 and 1947–48 vouch for the distinctiveness of an undescribed large mammal, a form of lechwe antelope. Their preservation has allowed comparative analyses of morphological characters to reveal this new species, the Upemba lechwe Kobus anselli sp. nov. It is most similar to the black lechwe K. smithemani and quite distinct from all other known taxa, including topotypical red lechwes K. leche. Prevailing threats and conservation concerns underwrite its formal description after neglect by science for decades. This lechwe is restricted to the Upemba wetlands, Kamalondo depression, south-east Congo basin (Katanga Province, Democratic Republic of Congo), and has declined greatly since the 1970s. Commercial poaching through the 1980s reduced c. 20000 individuals to under 1000 estimated today. Recognition of K. anselli as a distinct evolutionary entity was previously ignored, because the entrenched taxonomy assumed it was just another red lechwe. Its speciation seems to be recent, probably Pleistocene. Lechwes evolved in an archipelago of wetlands formed through vicariance of a more extensive drainage system, the Palaeo-Chambeshi, which extended from Katanga and north-east Zambia across the south-central African plateau, into the Kalahari basin. The Palaeo-Chambeshi was a major endoreic tributary of Palaeo-Lake Makgadikgadi. Its fragmentation isolated lechwes in the Kamalondo depression from wetlands in the Upper Zambezi–Okavango, Upper Kafue, and the Chambeshi and Luapula drainages. The belated discovery of K. anselli emphasizes the region's conservation significance. Because of its high species richness and high endemism, Katanga is a biodiversity hotspot within the encompassing Katanga–Chambeshi region, also covering eastern Angola and much of Zambia. A secure future for the critically endangered Upemba lechwe hinges on reducing adverse human impact and maintaining the integrity of its wetland habitat. Support for protected areas is critical. Maintenance of ecological processes, focused on aquatic systems, is especially important to conserve biodiversity. Recognition of the complex evolutionary history of the region (since the Late Neogene) underpins the scientific foundation for all conservation plans and activities. It prescribes why a regional conservation strategy should encompass the landscape mosaic, structured across neighbouring drainage systems (Lufira, Upper Lualaba and Chambeshi–Luapula rivers). A trans-frontier conservation area will consolidate the protected areas and land use systems of the region in an ecological context.},
